To test the Radial Profile Plugin and the Peak Calling procedure, a validation image was generated using the CV2 Package in Python.

The image contains 3 circles, and is split into two separate channels.

Circle 1:
Center Point: 100,100
Channel 1 Outer Radius = 50
Channel 2 Outer Radius = 90

Circle 2:
Center Point: 250,250
Channel 1 Outer Radius = 75
Channel 2 Outer Radius = 115

Circle 3:
Center Point: 400,400
Channel 1 Outer Radius = 75
Channel 2 Outer Radius = 90



Channel 1: Intensity increased in concentric rings from the center point until a radius of 25, where the intensity peaks and then linearly decreases until
reaching an intensity of 0 at the outer radius of channel 1.


Channel 2: A 5 pixel wide ring with maximum intensity starts at the outer radius of channel 1. Then a the intensity linearly increases until maxing
at the outer radius of channel 2.
